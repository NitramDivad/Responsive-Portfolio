                <p>Hi. As you may have guessed by now, I'm David. I'm a Kentucky native who has lived in Denver, CO for about eleven years. I work as a software engineer in the lending sector creating and maintaining mortgage origination software. A little known fact about me? I have been bestowed a title of honor as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Colonel" target="_blank" class="site-link">Kentucky Colonel</a>.</p>
                <p>You likely noticed from the photo that I"m a skier...and a relatively new skier at that. Although I only have two seasons under my belt, I have made the effort to ski as much as I can. For the 2017/2018 season, I hit the slopes for over 225,000 vertical feet of skiing. I tend to ski mostly at A-Basin, Vail, Beaver Creek, and Keystone.</p>
                <p>Beyond skiing, I travel as much as I can. I don't seem to get home to Kentucky as much as I'd like to, though! Any sort of outdoor activity is a plus with me, but with a six-month Web Development bootcamp underway, there's not going to be much time this summer to be outdoors hiking, biking, or even traveling for that matter.</p>
